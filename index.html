    <h1>Secure Shell (SSH)</h1>

    <p>
        SSH for Secure Shell is a way/pro of
        connecting to computers remotely.
        This process involves a client and
        a server to which the client wants to connect.
        It requires an ssh utility program like 
        <a href="https://www.openssh.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" >OpenSSH</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        To connect to a user on the server/host the command goes like this:
        <div>ssh username@hostname -p portNumber</div>
    </p>
    <p>
        where ssh is to invoke ssh utility proram 
        <a href="https://www.openssh.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" >OpenSSH</a>, username is the name of the user
        you want to connect to on the server. It's not your username.
        The hostname is the server on which the user lives. '-p' is 
        to specify the port number.
    </p>

    <p> 
        This process of connection works using a type of 
        authentication that require public and private keys.
    </p>
    <h3>Public Key</h3>
    <p>
        The public key is on the server/host and is publicaly
        available to use for any computer that wants to connect.
    </p>

    <h3>Private Key</h3>
    <p>
        The private key is provided by the server to the user and is stored on 
        the user's computer that wants to 
        connect and is it's specific for each user. This private key on the 
        user can be stolen as it's stored in the hardware. If stolen it can be 
        used to communicate to the server prentending to be the legit user.
        So it's better to enable passphrase to use the private key each time the user wants to
        login to the server.
</p>

<p class="process">
    The communication starts when user tell the server to connect, the server validates the user
    by asking for the private key. The user enables access to the pirvate key by typing 'yes' on the
    command line or passphrase if enabled. Then after authentication the server starts communicating 
    with the user by sending encrypted messages using public key. After reaching the user side the 
    messages are decrypted using the private key provided by the server stored in the user's computer.
